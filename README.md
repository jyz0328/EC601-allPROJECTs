EC 601 PROJECT2- "Restaurant Discovery Plan website” description
JINGYI ZHANG ,U26578499

Product Mission Statement:
I have named my product "Restaurant Discovery Plan website”, and it is an html website.
In this product, users can explore which restaurants are available at any location on a map. 
That is to say, users can click on any location to check restaurants nearby.
This product allows users to make informed decisions about where to find the restaurants they desire.
Also notice that I set the radius of restaurant to be searched as 1000m from location.

Product User Stories:
Mary is a newcomer to Boston and is unfamiliar with the restaurants available in the city. 
She wants to use "Restaurant Discovery Plan website” to discover restaurants in different locations in Boston.

Jessy found herself in an unfamiliar location due to a business trip and is looking for a place to have lunch.
She doesn't know which restaurants nearby serve the type of cuisine she prefers.
She wants to use "Restaurant Discovery Plan website” to identify locations with restaurants that match her preferences.


MVP (Minimum Viable Product):
My website should at least allow users to click on a location ,and then website should displays the latitude 
and longitude and the names of nearby restaurants. 
My website should also show the user's current location with a marker when the app is opened.
